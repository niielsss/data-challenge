# Underwater Image Enhancement / Augmentation

## Overview

The **Underwater Image Enhancement / Augmentation** project focuses on developing a tool to improve low-resolution underwater images by turning them into high-resolution ones. This tool will be especially helpful in fields like marine research and underwater photography, where poor visibility is a common problem due to water conditions and low lighting. The goal of this project is to enhance the quality and clarity of underwater images, making it easier for researchers and photographers to capture and analyze fine details.

## Problem Statement

Underwater images are often blurry, low in resolution, and lack clarity because of factors like poor lighting, light scattering, and other challenges in underwater environments. These issues make it difficult for marine researchers, archaeologists, and photographers to analyze or capture high-quality images. This project aims to solve these problems by providing a way to improve the resolution and clarity of underwater images.

## Innovative Idea

The main idea of this project is to use advanced image enhancement techniques, such as **super-resolution** and **deconvolution**, to improve the quality of underwater images. By applying these techniques, the goal is to turn low-resolution underwater images into clearer, high-resolution ones. This solution addresses the unique challenges of underwater imaging and has potential applications in marine biology, archaeology, and underwater tourism.

## Data

The project will use the **EUVP (Enhancing Underwater Visual Perception)** dataset, which includes both low-resolution and high-resolution underwater image pairs. This dataset provides a variety of underwater conditions, making it ideal for training and testing the enhancement model. It will allow the model to be trained on images captured in different underwater environments, such as varying depths, water types, and lighting conditions.

## Techniques and Tools

To enhance the images, the project will use the following techniques:

- **Deconvolution**: This technique will help address blurriness caused by light scattering and other distortions that are common in underwater images.
- **GAN**: This technique will train two networks—a generator that creates data and a discriminator that evaluates it—to compete against each other, helping the generator produce increasingly realistic outputs.
- **Super-resolution**: This method will generate higher-resolution images from lower-resolution inputs, improving the clarity and detail of the images.
- **Custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: These networks will be specifically designed to handle features unique to underwater images, such as color distortions and low contrast.

The model will be built using **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow** for deep learning, and **OpenCV** or **Pillow** for pre-processing the images (e.g., noise reduction and color balancing). Image quality will be measured using metrics like **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)** and **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)** to ensure the enhancement is effective.

## Ethical Considerations

It is important to ensure that the enhanced images accurately represent the underwater environment. The goal is to avoid exaggerating or misleading the details, especially in scientific applications. Accurate representation is crucial, particularly when the enhanced images are used for research or conservation efforts.

## First Steps

The first step of the project is to:

1. Collect or create a dataset of paired low-resolution and high-resolution underwater images.
2. Build a basic model to enhance the images using deconvolution.
3. Next up is to find a dataset that I can use for super-resolution.

Once the dataset is ready, the model will be trained and tested to improve the resolution and clarity of the images. Success will be determined when the model can significantly enhance the quality of underwater images, as shown by comparing the original and enhanced versions.
